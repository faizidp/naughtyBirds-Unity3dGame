# naughtyBirds-Unity3dGame
This one is little but intersting game done in Unity 3d
* I have not uploaded Whole Project because that would cost more data usage and currently i have limited package,
*  so i just uploaded the assets folder....
*  If u have been prior to Unity, perhaps u'd already know how to open the assets folder as Project other than follow me: 
                     *UnRar the naughtyBirds.rar file after downloading
                     *Create a new Project in Unity
                     * Paste the Assets folder of naughtyBirds.rar to Your newly created project folder... Overright if asked
                     * Enjoy :-)
